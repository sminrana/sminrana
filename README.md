I help founders and startups **build, fix, and ship mobile apps with a reliable backend**.

If your app is blocked by bugs, unstable APIs, auth issues, or backend problems — I handle the **app and backend together**, so things move fast without handoffs.

---

## What I Do

### 📱 Mobile App

* Build and improve mobile apps
* Fix critical bugs and crashes
* Integrate APIs and backend services
* Prepare apps for production & launch

### 🧠 Backend & APIs

* REST / JSON API design & fixes
* Authentication & user management
* Database design & migrations
* Third‑party integrations (payments, notifications, etc.)
* Performance, stability & production issues

---

## Typical Projects

* Fixing app + backend issues blocking launch
* Building MVPs (app + backend) for startups
* Cleaning up unstable backends used by mobile apps
* Adding new features across app and backend
* Debugging production issues end‑to‑end

---

## How I Work

* **Outcome‑focused** — solve the real blocker, not just write code
* **End‑to‑end ownership** — app and backend together
* **Clear communication** — no guessing, no finger‑pointing
* **Practical solutions** — ship first, improve iteratively

## Example Case Snapshots

**Problem:** App login failing due to backend auth issues
**Action:** Traced API + app flow, fixed auth logic and API responses
**Result:** Stable login, app ready for release

---

**Problem:** Mobile app blocked by slow and unreliable APIs
**Action:** Refactored backend endpoints and optimized queries
**Result:** Faster app performance and smoother user experience

---

## Tech Stack (as needed)

* Mobile: iOS / Cross‑platform (project‑dependent)
* Backend: Laravel / Django / Node / Firebase
* Databases: SQL / NoSQL
* APIs: REST, third‑party integrations
* Deployment: Cloud & production environments

*(Tools matter less than solving the problem.)*
