I help founders and startups **build, fix, and ship mobile apps with a reliable backend**.

If your app is blocked by bugs, unstable APIs, auth issues, or backend problems — I handle the **app and backend together**, so things move fast without handoffs.

## What I Do

### 📱 Mobile App

* Build and improve mobile apps
* Fix critical bugs and crashes
* Integrate APIs and backend services
* Prepare apps for production & launch

### 🧠 Backend & APIs

* REST / JSON API design & fixes
* Authentication & user management

* Third‑party integrations (payments, notifications, etc.)
* Performance, stability & production issues
