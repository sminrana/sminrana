# Hi, I’m a Mobile App Developer 👋

I build mobile apps with a mobile-first mindset, backed by over 10 years of experience working with backend systems and APIs.

## Mobile
- iOS: Swift, SwiftUI
- Android: Kotlin
- React Native
- Flutter

## Backend & APIs
- PHP
- TypeScript
- Python

## What I focus on
- MVPs and early-stage products
- End-to-end mobile apps
- Clean API integration
- Maintainable, readable code

## How I work
I prefer simple architectures, clear communication, and shipping usable features instead of over-engineering.

This GitHub contains real projects, experiments, and tools built while working on mobile and backend systems.
